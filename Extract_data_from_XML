# Access-Web-Data-with-Python
The program will prompt for a URL, read the XML data from that URL using urllib,
and then parse and extract the comment counts from the XML data, compute the sum of the numbers in the file.
The project came from *Using Python to Access Web Data* on Coursera.


import urllib
from BeautifulSoup import *
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

url = raw_input('Enter your url:')
xml = urllib.urlopen(url).read()

tree = ET.fromstring(xml)
lst = tree.findall('.//count')
sum = 0

for item in lst:
	sum += int(item.text)

print sum
