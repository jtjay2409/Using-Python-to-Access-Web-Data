# Access-Web-Data-with-Python
In this part I wrote a Python program that expands on http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/urllinks.py. 
The program will use *urllib* to read the HTML from the data files below, 
extract the href= vaues from the anchor tags, 
scan for a tag that is in a particular position relative to the first name in the list, 
follow that link and repeat the process a number of times and report the last name you find.

The exercise came from "Programming and the Web for Beginners" on Coursera.

import urllib
from BeautifulSoup import *

url = raw_input('Enter your start url:')
co = raw_input('Enter your count:')
posi = raw_input('Enter your position:')

for i in range(int(co)):
	html = urllib.urlopen(url).read()
	soup = BeautifulSoup(html)
	tags = soup('a')
	number = 0
	for tag in tags:
		number += 1
		if number == int(posi):
			url = tag.get('href')
			if i == int(co)-1:
				print tag.contents[0]
			break
